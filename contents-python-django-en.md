# What do we do for work?
## Carles
- C++/Qt software engineer at Mendeley
- Some Python (scripts at work, evenings and weekends, Python code Dojos, etc.)
- Using GNU/Linux for a long time
- Long time ago: system administrator / network administrator
--


## Jen
- Worked 2 years at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) as a data manager
- More into animals (special birds) than into programming
---
# Â¿What were our roles on the boat?
- Jen was the data manager (of all 22 teams!)
- I was the data manager assistant/software engineer end up:
 - Help building the data management system (Django)
 - Telecomunications setup
 - Connecting science equipment
 - Setting up the storage

# Why is ACE different?
- Usually science expeditions focus on some part of the Antarctic (e.g. near South Georgia)
--

- First expedition of the Swiss Polar Institute

--
- It was organised very quickly
???
Mention that we were called 6 weeks in advance

# Data management
---
## What is it?
- Backup all the collected data
- Keep a log of what's happening, where, when
- Keep a sample database
- Create metadata records
--


## Why?
- Backup to avoid losing data and for the institution to have the data after the 2 year embargo
- Discard data if any device was faulty
- Make data easier to discover
---
# We had many IT tasks
- Setup the data storage (2 NAS, 64 TB, 2 UPS, etc.)
--

- Create utilities to backup from hard disks, shared volumes, etc.

--
- Create an Intranet webpage for the data entry, utilities, etc.

--
- Design and implement a mail system that works with unstable 128 kbits for 80 people

--
- Create a way to upload videos for the news (we had journalists on board)

--
- Download data (ice images, weather models) for the scientists

--
- Help scientists connecting different equipment (like snow flake counter)

--
- Fix a winch (software part)
--

# science-data-management
- Jen asked: Will you help me building a database?
--

- I answered: yes! (and thought of Mysql and _create table_...)
--


Jen also meant a Web system to introduce data in the database!

# Django
---
I knew:
- Python
--

- Flask
--

- Mysql
--

- SQLAlchemy
--

- Mustache
--


But... How should I create the forms to enter data into the database?
--


I asked Fran... and he said...
--


# Django!
--

(I thought... nooooo...)
--


Fran created an example... and I loved it!
???
Thought "nooooo..." because it's big, we didn't have time
---
# One week of Django
I went back home and really enjoyed learning Django:
- Writing a Django models is easier than Mysql _create table_ (with foreign keys, etc.)
- Easier to change the models and migrate
- We needed authentication of users
- Permissions for tables were useful
- Templates are very well integrated with models
- All the admin part that we used has a good default UI
- Easy to extend
--


And it has very good off-line documentation!
---
# Django models
```python
class StorageCrate(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)
    comment = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
```
--

- It creates the forms automatically
- If the model didn't exist: creates the tables in the database
- If the model already existed: creates the migration code
- Deals with foreign keys, relations, etc.
- The Mysql tables have the same structures than we would have created (and we used Mysql without Django for some tasks)

# In retrospect
Django was a very good tool to do what we had to do:
- Without Django we would have taken much longer! 
- Django didn't get on the way as I had thought
- Django _commands_ were very easy to implement and useful to access the models from command line parameters, widely used for many of our scripts
- Django developers are very nice and helpful! Thanks for the concise error messages:
```bash
main.Project.title: (fields.E120) CharFields must define a 'max_length' attribute.
```
--
- Django documentation is very well written!
- Admin forms were easy to adapt and change
???
If Django didn't exist I should have implemented for the expedition, in a hacky way

# What is Django?
From the Django website:
```bash
Django makes it easier to build
better Web apps more quickly and
with less code.
```
--


Data manager thinks:
```bash
We need to build a database
```
--

![images](images/clipart/light-bulb-idea.jpg)

Django for data managers?
???
And for other professions: cooks, biologists, etc.
---
## Django very useful features for us
- Admin forms were easy to adapt and change (we could work around if not possible)
- _commands_ are fantastic!

--

## Django not too good things for our use case
- Some modules use resources (CSS, js, etc.) from the Internet (e.g. debug module). This didn't work for us
- Hard to change (only via changing the template?) the main admin page
---
## pip 
pip wasn't "bad connection friendly":
- No progress bar
- We didn't see how to see easily the URIs being download (e.g. apt-get --show-uris to download them overnight)
- When bad networking: error messages weren't clear

--

man rsync, --progress:
```bash
This  option  tells  rsync  to  print  information  showing  the
progress of the transfer. This gives a bored user  something  to
watch.
```
I'd say "it helps my impatience".

--

## Python help
Python off-line help could have been better (we relied on examples and source code)
---
# Django closing the circle
We wanted to thanks Django somehow for all the fantastic help.

- I thought of fixing at least one bug that we experienced during the expedition
--

- Bug #28120 reported and fixed! (thanks for the quick code review, merge...)
---
# Python/Django ideas if you went to an expedition
- Take lots of code with you (e.g. Calibre, other projects, etc.). This was more useful than books and documentation
--

- Use an IDE like Pycharm that allows you to navigate code of your libraries easier
--

- Download the offline Django documentation: you will feel almost online!

--

Actually also download Wikipedia!

# Introduction
- We had 2 Iridium systems
- Initially one for calls, another one for Internet
- This is, 128 kbits for (officialy) 80 people
- The Iridium connections are very unstable

# Iridium
- 66 Iridium satellites
--

- Iridium name: originally had to be 77 satellites: atomic number of Iridium
--

- There are spare satellites for when there are problems
--

- Signal on the north and south pole! But VERY slow and unstable: it connects and disconnects because satellites are not geostacionary
--

- Satellites are around 780 Km from the Eart (GPS and Inmarsat around 20.000 Km)
--

- Sometimes the satellites are visible: Iridium flares!
--

- They are launching new satellites
