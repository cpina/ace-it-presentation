As a team we: 
- managed the data of all 22 science projects
 - set up the data management recording system (Django);
 - set up the data storage and back-ups;
 - liaised with scientists to back up data, record metadata in a database and create metadata records;

- telecommunications setup:
 - onboard network;

# Why is ACE different?
- Usually science expeditions focus on a small area of the Antarctic
--

- Only other similar expedition was Discovery II in the 1950's
--

- Sampled and studied marine and terrestrial habitats
--

- First expedition of the Swiss Polar Institute
--

- It was organised very quickly
???
Mention that we were called 6 weeks in advance

# Data management
---
## What is it?
- Backup all the collected data
- Keep a log of what's happening: 
 - ultimate goal - to be able to describe where, when, by whom and for what reason the data were collected
- Keep a database of all samples collected
- Create metadata records of all data sets so they can be discovered
--


## Why?
- Backup to avoid losing data and to archive it properly for the future
- The data can be made publicly available after the 2 year embargo
- Make data easier to discover and usable by others in the future
---
# We had many IT tasks
- Setup the data storage (2 NAS, 64 TB, 2 UPS, etc.)
--

- Create utilities to backup from USB hard disks and network-attached computers

--
- Create an intranet webpage for the data entry, utilities and to disseminate information on board

--
- Design and implement an e-mail system that works with an unstable 128 kbit connection for 80 people

--
- Create a way to upload videos for the news (we had journalists on board)

--
- Download data (ice images, weather models) for the scientists

--
- Help scientists to connect different equipment (like snow flake counter)

--
- Fix a winch (software part)
--
